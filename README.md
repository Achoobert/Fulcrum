# Fulcrum Keyboard
The Fulcrum Keyboard is an ergo-mechanical split keyboard with extra thumb functionality. It has 20 keys, two rotary encoders, and two 5-way switches.

The keyboard uses 20  key switches, two rotary encoders, and two 5-way switches.

The original inspiration for such a small number of keys came from Ben Vallack’s "Piano" board. I have made some pretty significant changes from his design, but the core idea of putting several of the alpha keys on a second layer is what drives this board’s design.

The four regular thumb keys are low profile choc switches, and the rest are MX. This is done to accommodate for the fact that your thumb sits on lower plane than the rest of your fingers while typing. In the future I may explore ways to make this height difference even greater.

The rotary encoders are positioned and angled to make them as easy to reach and use as possible. They are right where your hands expect them.

The same is true with the 5-way switch joysticks on the thumbs. They are effortless to use. These joysticks are really the defining feature of this keyboard. They open up such a huge field of utility that once you use it, it's hard to imagine ever going back to a keyboard that doesn't have them again.
